This is a demo application for illustrating both the usage of Cloud Vision API and Speech Recognizer API.

## Usage

First insert an image from your gallery.

Then, say what you see.

Compare the results.

Will Vision API fall short of its purpose or will Speech Recognition betray you?

## References

The Vision API code was imported and modified from GCP's sample : https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/cloud-vision/tree/master/android
